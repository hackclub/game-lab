## The Editor

Run games by hitting the \`Run\` button or pressing \`shift+enter\`.

If this is your first time using Sprig try going 
through the challenges in the learn tab.

You can also start with an empty file and 
go through [this tutorial](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig-gallery/blob/main/src/routes/getting-started.md#lets-make-our-first-game-in-sprig 
).

If you get stuck you can talk to other people in the community
about Sprig on [Hack Club's Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack).

## Level Design

Sprig games are made up of grids of square tiles.

### setLegend(bitmaps)

Tell Sprig what types of sprites are available in your game. 
Bitmap keys must be a single character. 
We recommend storing character keys in variables.

\`\`\`js
const player = "p";
setLegend([ player, bitmap\`...\` ]);
\`\`\`

To create a new bitmap, type \`bitmap\` and then two backticks (\`\` \` \`\`). 
Click on the highlighted "bitmap" button to edit your drawing:

\`\`\`js
setLegend( 
    [ "p", bitmap\`...\`],
    [ "w", bitmap\`...\`]
)
\`\`\`

The order of sprite types in your legend also determines the z-order of drawing them.
Sprite types that come first are drawn on top.

### setBackground(bitmapKey)

Tiles a bitmap as the background of the game:

\`\`\`js
setBackground(spriteKey)
\`\`\`

This only changes the visuals of the game.

### setMap(level)

Designing a level is like drawing a bitmap:

\`\`\`js
map\`...\`
\`\`\`

The characters in the map come from the order of your bitmap legend.
Levels don't have to be kept track of in a legend, you should store them in a variable yourself. 
You can call \`setMap\` to clear the game and load a new level:

\`\`\`js
const level = map\`...\`
setMap(level)
\`\`\`

You might want to keep track of multiple levels using an array to switch between them mid-game:

\`\`\`js
const levels = [
    map\`...\`,
    map\`...\`,
    // etc.
]
setMap(levels[0])

// Later:
setMap(levels[1])
\`\`\`

### setSolids(bitmapKey)

Solid sprites can't overlap with each other. 
This is useful for creating things like walls:

\`\`\`js
setSolids(["p", "w"]);
\`\`\`

### setPushables(pushMap)

Want sprites to be able to push each other around? Use \`setPushables\` to map a bitmap key to a list of bitmaps that it can push around:

\`\`\`js
setPushables({ "p": ["b", "p"] })
\`\`\`

> **Watch out!** Make sure everything you pass to \`setPushables\` is also marked as a solid or they won't be pushed around.
> 
> For more advanced usage, you could update the solids list in-game to enable and disable pushables dynamically.

## User Input

Game Lab has eight inputs  \`w\`, \`a\`, \`s\`, \`d\`, \`i\`, \`j\`, \`k\`, \`l\`.

Typically \`w\`, \`a\`, \`s\`, \`d\` are used as directional controls.

### onInput(type, callback)

Do something when the player presses a control:

\`\`\`js
onInput("a", () => {
    // Move the player one tile to the right
    getFirst("p").x += 1
})
\`\`\`

### afterInput(callback)

Runs after ever input event has finished being handled. Useful for tasks like checking win states:

\`\`\`js
afterInput(() => {
    if (getAll("blocks").length > 0) {
        console.log("you win")
    }
})
\`\`\`

## Sprites and Tiles

Each tile can contain any number of sprites stacked on top of each other.

Sprites contain:
\`\`\`
{
    type
    x
    y
    dx
    dy
}
\`\`\`

You can move the sprite by setting \`x\` and \`y\`. 
Collisions are checked; 
the value won't change if the sprite is being blocked by a solid object!

The \`bitmapKey\` can also be changed to update the rendered graphic and collision rules the sprite will follow.

\`\`\`js
sprite.y += 1
sprite.type = "p"
\`\`\`

\`dx\` and \`dy\` are cleared after \`afterInput\`. 
They can be used to check if the sprite moved and by how much.

You can remove a sprite with \`sprite.remove()\`.

### getTile(x, y)

Returns a list of the sprites in the specified tile.

### tilesWith(arrayOfTypes)

Returns a list of the tiles with all types contained in them.

\`\`\`js
tilesWith("b")
\`\`\`

\`tilesWith\` accepts multiple sprite types.

\`\`\`js
tilesWith("b", "p", ...)
\`\`\`

### addSprite(x, y, spriteType)

Creates a new sprite of the given type.

### clearTile(x, y)

Removes all sprites from the specified tile.

### getAll(type)

Returns all sprites of the given type. 
If no bitmap key is specified, it returns all the sprites in the game.

### getFirst(type)

Returns the first sprite of a given type. 
Useful if you know there's only one of a sprite, such as with a player character.

Shortcut for \`getAll(type)[0]\`.

## Text

### addText(string, options = { x, y, color })

You can add text with optional \`x\`, \`y\`, and \`color\`.

For example:

\`\`\`js
addText("hello", { 
    x: 10, 
    y: 4, 
    color: [ 255, 0, 0 ] // red
})
\`\`\`

### clearText()

Clears all text on the screen.

## Music and Sound Effects

Game Lab comes bundled with a built-in sound engine and sequencer! You can use this to write background music, or with a high BPM to make sound effects.

You can create a tune with the \`tune\` keyword. 
As usual, click on the button to open an editor window.

\`\`\`js
// Create a tune:
const melody = tune\`...\`

// Play it:
playTune(melody)

// Play it 5 times:
playTune(melody, 5)

// Play it until the heat death of the universe:
const playback = playTune(melody, Infinity)

// Or make it shut up early:
playback.end()
\`\`\`
