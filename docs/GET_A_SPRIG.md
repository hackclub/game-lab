# Get a Sprig!

**Anyone can submit to the gallery, but read the details below if you want your very own Sprig.** If you have any questions, join #sprig on our [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack)!

Sprig consoles are a limited run and have been ready for delivery since end of 2022*.

Get on the waitlist now by [sharing your game](https://sprig.hackclub.com/get) and having it approved by one of our project maintainers. Once your GitHub pull request is approved, we'll collect your shipping details.

There are only a few requirements to get a Sprig console:

1. You must be in high school or younger (this will be checked before mailing)
2. Your game must use the Sprig editor
3. Your game has a minimum of 5 mins of gameplay
4. Your game is original

<small>(* Our aim is to ship everywhere except US-sanctioned and trade-/mail-restricted nations.)</small>

Happy hacking!
